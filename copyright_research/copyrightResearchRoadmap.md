## *★ Background on Preservation and Dissemination Rights ★*
Cultural heritage institutions hold an immense responsibility to preserve and make available their audiovisual collections about history, science, humanity, and global culture. Smithsonian library, archive, and museum collections of audiovisual works are some of the nation’s most exceptional, and SI libraries, archives, and museums hold significant rights to undertake their preservation and access mission dedicated to “the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”<br/>


<blockquote><details><summary>§107 and Fair Use</summary><blockquote><br/>
§107 of the U.S. Copyright Law provides specific rights for unauthorized, and otherwise infringing, copy-making and use of copyright material for various purposes. These prescribed ‘Fair Uses’ are legally case-dependent and subject to a situational four factor test, however preservation of audiovisual materials under §107 has long been an explicit exemption endorsed by Congress. As H.R. Rep. 94-1476 at 73, under the heading “Reproduction and uses for other purposes,” states:

    “A problem of particular urgency is that of preserving for posterity prints of motion pictures made before 1942. Aside from the deplorable fact that in a great many cases the only existing copy of a film has been deliberately destroyed, those that remain are in immediate danger of disintegration; they were printed on film stock with a nitrate base that will inevitably decompose in time. The efforts of the Library of Congress, the American Film Institute, and other organizations to rescue and preserve this irreplaceable contribution to our cultural life are to be applauded, and the making of duplicate copies for purposes of archival preservation certainly falls within the scope of "fair use".” ^^

<br/>
While this 1976 citation specifically employs nitrate film preservation to make its point about the importance and Fair Use eligibility of audiovisual “archival preservation,” the Smithsonian’s status as a non-profit educational institution plays an additional and critically favorable role in §107’s exempting of non-commercial and educational copy-making purposes in its four-factor test. In spite of these realities, a 2010 report commissioned by the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress articulates timidity among some persons and institutions at invoking §107 rights for preservation and dissemination:

     “While fair use is frequently invoked, there is little case law interpreting its application to specific situations. Some archivists believe the lack of applicable case law discourages institutional general counsels from authorizing preservation and access programs on the basis of fair use.” ^^

(The same The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States: A National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age publication provides a summary overview of §107, §108, and §110 rights as they pertain to audiovisual preservation. For further research, the U.S. Copyright Office’s Fair Use Index, available via https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/, provides a useful up-to-date summary of case law and litigation summaries that involve Fair Use defenses.)

# PDCO RECEIVING AND REVIEWING PROCESS

This document details the steps for TBMA team members to process PDCO material received for Museum accession considerations. Members will refer to the Smartsheet questionnaires filled by curatorial staff members and the team share folder (links below) to prepare collections for pre-acquisition, accession, and DAMs ingestion.

## Pre-Acquisition
1. Receiving new entry on Time-Base Media questionnaire
   - BM/CC receive notifications when additions/changes are made to this sheet.
2. Verify questionnaire data (BM/CC)
   - Verify if files are in J drives (Questionnaire: J Drive folder location)
     - If files are received via Dropbox, confirm access and download copies to J-drive.
     - Make sure all files are playable.
     - Reach out to staff member who entered the data for any questions.
     - Create a folder in 04_TR-reviews with: CuratorName_CollectionName.

              ```
              makechecksum [file or package 1] [file or package 2] [file or package 3]
              ```
           
            OR 
            - run checksum in CLI:  
              (MAC) `md5deep -bre [file or package] >> [filepath]/checksums.txt`  
              (PC)  `md5sum [file path]/[file names] >> [filepath]/checksums.txt` 

    - Save as *CollectionName_TBM_PDCO_TR-assignment-info.xlsx*

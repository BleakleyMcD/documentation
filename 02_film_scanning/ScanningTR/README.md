# Motion Picure Film Scanning Instructions for NMAAHC TR films
### TR = Temporary Receipt - objects in the Museum's possession but not yet accessioned into the Collection
### These scans are made for: 
- internal, pre-accession use by NMAAHC Curatorial
- content/condition assessment by NMAAHC Time-based Media Archives & Conservation staff to plan and prioritize conservation/preservation and archival processing
#### **Don't let them out into the wild!**

1. ### Thread film through scanner film path
    - always double check to make sure you have enough leader to capture the entire film

<br>

2. ### Click "Load Film" on the ScanStation software

3. ### Choose the "Std 16mm 2.5K @ 60fps" configuration and click "Load Film"
    - We will be creating two files per reel files: 
        - 1 x SD 720x480 mp4
        - 1 x 2K 2048x1536 mp4
    - The 2K will be for internal "team TBM" assessment
    - The SD file can be provided to other Museum staff for internal use

4. ### Open 2K template for format - 8mm, 16mm, etc.
    - these can be found in:
        - S:\01_Scans\00_ScanStation_templates\03_templates_TR
    - the job setting should look like this:

<br>
<br>

- "Reel Name", "Film Type" and "Flip Image Horizontally" will have to be adjusted to fit the reel being scanned. 
- "Playback Framerate" may also need adjusted.
- **It is suggested to set "Allow file overwrites" to OFF**
    - deleting "false start" files from the NAS is much less painful than overwriting a completed, successful scan. Change this at your own risk/sanity!
- _Pro tip: "Auto reduce scan rate" will cut the scan rate in 1/2 if the data flow is to high for the system. If this happens, you may find that a 1/2 rate speed is unnesscarilly slow and a manual adjustment from 30fps to, say, 25fps will largely solve the problem. If you want to try this, simply turn this setting to off and adjust the scan rate manually. Particularly useful for long reel._

5. ### Find the first frame of the film where you want the scaning to begin
    - set this frame to frame 0
    - please include all original leader in the scan

<br>

---

<br>

6. ### Scan through the film and find the last frame where you want the scanning to end
    - please include all original leader in the scan
    - this will give you the total number of frames to be scanned, which **should** also be the total number of frames in film + original leader. 
    - write this number of frames on the fillable PDF Film Inspection Sheet for this particular film

7. ### Determine your framing

- choose "Custom" to pull up the framing output window

- **_make sure your aspect ratio is locked to 4:3_**
- for both the 2K and SD scan, create a framing that extends into the film edge and includes some of the image in the frames above and below.

8. The output settings should look like this:

- disable the audio track if there is no audio
- if there is audio make sure it is set to 48kHz / 16 bit. The software sometimes defaults to 44.1kHz **(why???)** which will make your file's sound be out of sync.

<details><summary>Definition and Scope</summary>

>### These guidelines pertain to analog and digital moving image objects within the Collection of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). They include the cataloging and naming of moving image objects, art installations with time-based elements, and digital objects and their carriers. Additional guidelines for Primary Digital Collection Objects (PDCO) can be found in the Guidelines for Cataloging PDCO. These guidelines build upon and should be used in conjunction with the general cataloging rules enumerated in the NMAAHC Cataloging Standards and Guidelines.

<br/>

>### **Work and Instantiation** <p> Cataloging time-based materials addresses an object on two levels: (1) the physical object and (2) its content. The terms “work” and “instantiation” are frequently used to describe the difference between the physical object and its content and are defined as follows:
- Workthe content on a reel of film, videotape, cassette tape, DVD, digital file, etc.
<br>

- Instantiation: the format that carries the work (i.e., content); meaning, the physical manifestation/iteration on which the work can be found (e.g., 16mm film, 8mm film, videotape, DVD, etc.)
<br>

The Museum’s collection often contains the same work on multiple instantiations with different formats and physical characteristics. For example, the Pearl Bowser film collection holds multiple copies of the film Hands of Inge created when the film was made around 1962: work prints, release prints, negatives, answer prints, etc. Comprehensively cataloging Hands of Inge requires accounting for the differences between each of these instantiations as well as describing their content.

<br>

<details><summary>Pre-cataloging Preparation</summary>
One of the first steps in the cataloging process is the retrieval and evaluation of associated materials for the object(s) being cataloged. Below are some steps catalogers can take to prepare for detailed cataloging.

<br>

1. Check the accession file for background information about the object(s) being cataloged. The acquisition accession form is especially useful for providing pertinent information about the object's content, maker, and significance.
2. Check the conservation report for information about the object’s physical properties. For example, film stock, format, dimensions, information recorded on the container etc.
3. Check reference images for information that can be gleaned such as whether there is an optical soundtrack and whether the picture is in black-and-white or color. Similarly, reference images of film often include title slides that contain information that can be useful during preliminary cataloging.
4. Consult with the Media Archives & Conservation Team, Media Archivist, DAMS Manager and/or Collections Information Specialist to obtain access copies of the work and communicate any questions/concerns that arise. Confer with the registrars and Curator of Record for any questions about acquisition or context.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>Item-level records vs. Components</summary>
Depending on the type of instantiation and the particularities of the collection in which it was acquired, cataloging may utilize separate TMS object records for each instantiation or combine several instantiations from the same accession into a single TMS object record using components. Instantiations from different accessions should always receive separate TMS records to properly record the acquisition information for each. With either approach, be sure to record the differences between the instantiations (format, attributes, dimensions, etc.) thoroughly so that users can distinguish them from one another easily. Consult with the Media Archivist, Collections Information Specialist and/or Registrars if unsure when instantiations should receive separate TMS records

> #### HANDS OF INGE (2012.79.1.9.1ac-.2a): in the example above, a work print and a release print of HANDS OF INGE were accessioned and are cataloged in separate TMS records. The title refers to the work and is the same in both records, while the object name field distinguishes the release print from the work print. Across both records, information about the work will remain the same, but details of the physical characteristics of the different instantiations will vary.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>Determining Moving Image Works or Content</summary>
When possible, viewing the content in part or in its entirety is beneficial for cataloging. If the object has been digitized by NMAAHC, its content may be available through the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS), or via the DAMS Manager or Media Archivist. The NMAAHC film collection includes commercial releases in addition to rare and unique works, which may be available through external sources such as YouTube, Internet Archive, or the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.
<p>
Film databases such as Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Internet Archive, American Film Institute (AFI), library databases and other reputable sources are all useful reservoirs of information, as are Media Archives and Conservation Team members and reference library. Survey several sources to get a comprehensive account of the work. Please note that when record of a work cannot be found in external sources, that rare work requires more detailed and comprehensive cataloging description than widely known commercial works.
<p>
When a work is not viewable and the content cannot be determined, complete the catalog record as thoroughly as possible based on the information that is currently known about the object. Be clear about what is ambiguous or unknown about the work. For example, an unviewable work may be cataloged as “16mm film of unknown footage attributed to Pearl Bowser,” or “Reel of unknown footage from the Pearl Bowser collection.” This communicates clearly what is both known and unknown about the instantiation and the unknown content. The catalog record can be updated when the object becomes viewable or more information is known.
<br>
<details><summary>Types of Works</summary>
For cataloging purposes, it may be helpful to think of moving images in terms of a few broad conceptual groups such as formal works and informal works, finished works and unfinished works, fiction and nonfiction works, etc. We will refer to these as “Types of Works” for the purposes of this document. While the Types of Works are not official categories, the types can assist with determining titles/object names, which dates should be reflected in the TMS record, how to construct descriptions, which constituent role types to use, etc.

- Formal works: includes complete works that have been published or officially released with title, or for which a title is provided within the work itself or by the creator. Formal works are more likely to be prolific/pervasive in the public than informal works
    - e.g., feature films, televised programs, documentaries, etc.
- Informal works: refers to works that have not been officially published or released. In many instances, informal works were never assigned a formal title by their creators and are rare/not generally available in the public
    - e.g., home movies, amateur films, footage that have not been published, unfinished works by filmmakers
- Fiction works: refers to works that describe imaginary events and people
    - e.g., fictional movies and episodes of fictional television shows
- Nonfiction works: works that are based on facts, real events, and real people. They tend to be biographical or historical in nature
    - e.g., documentary films, filmed/televised interviews, filmed/televised sporting events, time-based artworks
- Unfinished works: works that have been deemed incomplete
    - e.g., unfinished film projects
<p>
Keep in mind that Types of Works are not strict categories, and some works may bridge multiple types. For example, the film Unspoken Conversation bears hallmarks of both informal and formal works. Filmmaker Iman Hameen created Unspoken Conversation while she was a student (informal), though it is a titled work and has since had a small commercial release (formal). When cataloging works that do not fit neatly into one category, use your best judgement when determining how these work type categories may guide cataloging decisions.

<details><summary>Numbering Moving Image Works</summary>
<p>

Numbering guidelines for moving image objects combine the needs of NMAAHC’s Media Archives & Conservation Team and the numbering schema set forth by the Registrars. Given the variety of possible scenarios and the possible complexity of moving image objects, it is not practical to outline all scenarios in this document. Catalogers should consult the Media Archivist and/or Collections Information Specialist when uncertain about what numbering is most appropriate.
</P>
<br>

<blockquote><details><summary>Numbering PDCO</summary>
Numbering moving image PDCO conforms closely to numbering other forms of PDCO within the Collection, where the accession year and collection number are combined to generate an object number. A work number may be added to the sequence if there are multiple objects in the collection. The most general formulation for numbering moving image PDCO is:

<br>

*[AccessionYear].[CollectionNumber].[WorkNumber]*

-   **Accession Year** = the year in which the collection was accessioned
-   **Collection Number** = the order in which the collection was accessioned in that accession year
-   **Work Number** = the work (or object) number in the accessioned collection

<blockquote><details open><summary>Storage Media</summary>
If the PDCO arrived via storage media that was not accessioned but is stored and tracked (e.g., DVD, flash drive, hard drive etc.), the storage media should be added as an Accessory Component to the first object in the accession that is contained on the storage media. This accessory is tracked in the Components module and the accessory should receive Component Numbers with suffixes such as _acc1, _acc2, _acc3, etc.

<br>

<blockquote><details><summary>Numbering Analog Objects</summary>
For analog moving image objects, the character ‘a’ should be used to designate the first ‘carrier’ for the essence or signal (film, video, DVD, etc.). Subsequent characters (‘b,’ ‘c,’ ‘d’ etc.) should be used for any remaining ‘carriers’ in the instantiation. The most general formulation for numbering a single- component analog object is:

<br>

*[AccessionYear].[CollectionNumber].[WorkNumber]. [InstantiationNumber] [ComponentElement]*

- Accession Year = the year in which the collection was accessioned
- Collection Number = the order in which the collection was accessioned in that accession year
- Work Number = the work (or object) number in the accessioned collection
- Instantiation Number = a number for the instantiation of a work (or object). Instantiation numbers are only used when there are multiple instantiations of a work in a collection.
- Component Element = a letter for each physical component of the object. This should start with ‘a’, for the first film and each additional film in the instantiation would receive a subsequent letter

<details><summary>Numbering Archival Collections</summary>
Archival collections, such as the Pearl Bowser archival collection (A2012.79), will also have a Series Number between the Collection Number and the Work Number. This number is used to indicate the type of media. Films in archival collections usually have 1 designated as the Series Number. The formulation would look like:

<p>

*[AccessionYear].[CollectionNumber].[SeriesNumber].[WorkNumber].[InstantiationNumber][ComponentElement]*

<br>

###### AFRICAN SPEAKERS (2012.79.1.2.1AB-.2AB): IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, TWO INSTANTIATIONS OF AFRICAN SPEAKERS WERE ACCESSIONED AS PART OF THE PEARL BOWSER ARCHIVAL COLLECTION: 2012.79.1.2.1AB AND 2019.79.1.2.2AB, A BLACK-AND-WHITE COMBINED NEGATIVE AND A POSITIVE BLACK-AND-WHITE. THE ACCESSION YEAR IS 2012, THE COLLECTION NUMBER IS 79, THE SERIES NUMBER IS 1, THE WORK NUMBER IS 2, THE INSTANTIATION NUMBERS ARE 1 AND 2 RESPECTIVELY AND THE COMPONENTS A & B REPRESENT EACH REEL OF ACETATE FILM.

<details><summary>Numbering Accessories</summary>
<p>

- #### Projection reels and film canisters
Projection reels, film cores, canisters and film laboratory paper ephemera are treated as Accessory Components to the film component which they accompany. Accessories are not accessioned objects and therefore receive suffixes such as _acc1, _acc2, _acc3 etc.

<br>

###### LET THE CHURCH SAY AMEN! (2012.79.1.74.1ab): IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, THE WORK LET THE CHURCH SAY AMEN! IS SPREAD ACROSS TWO REELS OF FILM. THE FIRST REEL'S COMPONENT NUMBER IS 2012.79.1.74.1a AND THE SECOND REEL IS 2012.79.1.74.1b. THE PROJECTION REEL THE FIRST FILM IS ON IS 2012.79.1.74.1a_acc1 AND THE PROJECTION REEL THE SECOND REEL OF FILM IS ON IS 2012.79.1.74.1b_acc1. THE METAL CANISTERS HOLDING THE REELS ARE 2012.79.1.74.1a_acc2 AND 2012.79.1.74.1b_acc2, RESPECTIVELY. THE ORIGINAL SHIPPING CONTAINER THEY CAME IN IS 2012.79.1.74.1ab_acc1.

<details><summary>Cataloging TMS Core Fields</summary>
<p>
<blockquote><details><summary>Classification</summary>

<p>

All film and video objects are cataloged with the classification Media Arts-Film and Video. For time-based media artwork, add the Visual Arts classification as well. For archival collections with time-based media, both the Archival Collection and Media Arts-Film and Video classifications should be used.
</details></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><details><summary>Object Names and Titles</summary>

<p>

<blockquote><details><summary>Formal works</summary>

<p>

Formal works include complete works that have been published or officially released with a title, or for which a title is provided within the work itself or by the creator. For these objects, enter the formal title in the Title field. Use the Object Name field in addition to the Title only for disambiguation, for example, if the collection has multiple instantiations of the same work.

<img src="images/TBM_cataloging_MI_05.jpg">

###### BOY! WHAT A GIRL (2015.167.1.1AB): IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, THE FILM’S OFFICIALLY RELEASED TITLE IS INCLUDED IN THE TITLE FIELD. AN OBJECT NAME, THOUGH OPTIONAL, IS NOT ASSIGNED.

<br>

<blockquote><details><summary>Clips or segments of formal works</summary>
When the object contains only a portion of a formal work, use the Object Name field with the formula “[Moving image format] clip from [Title of Work].” If the character limit allows, include more information about the subject of the clip: “[Carrier] clip of [subject] from [Title of Work].” Similarly, if the character limits are too restrictive, one can omit the carrier from the Object Name: “Clip of [long subject/Long Title of Work.]”

<img src="images/TBM_cataloging_MI_06.jpg">

###### FILM CLIP OF “SHEIK OF ARABY” FROM TIN PAN ALLEY (2015.275.29.1A): IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, ONLY A SCENE WHERE THE ACTORS PERFORM “SHEIK OF ARABY” IN THE FEATURE FILM TIN PAN ALLEY WAS ACCESSIONED. THE OBJECT NAME “FILM CLIP OF ‘SHEIK OF ARABY’ FROM TIN PAN ALLEY” IS GENERATED USING THE FORMULA ABOVE. THE TITLE FIELD IS LEFT BLANK.
</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Series of formal works</summary>
If a complete work is from a series/anthology, use the formula “[Series Title]: [Episode Title]” to generate a title for the Title field. The series title should also be entered in the Series/Portfolio field. An Object Name is not necessary unless it aids with disambiguation.

<img src="images/TBM_cataloging_MI_07.jpg">

###### CAMERA THREE: THE JAZZ OF WILBUR DE PARIS (2015.275.41.1A): IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, THE SERIES TITLE, CAMERA THREE, IS INCLUDED IN THE TITLE FIELD BEFORE THE COLON AND THE EPISODE TITLE APPEARS AFTER THE COLON WITHOUT QUOTES. THE SERIES TITLE IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PORTFOLIO/SERIES FIELD.

<p>

If only a portion of the work was accessioned, the Title field should be left blank, and an Object Name should be created using the formula for “Clips or segments for formal works” above. The series name should still be entered in the Series/Portfolio field.

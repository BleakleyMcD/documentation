<br/>
The most general formulation for numbering films on one reel is:

>**2018.37.2.1a**

*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*
<br/>
<br/>

The most general formulation for numbering films on multiple reels is:
>**2018.37.2.1a**
>**2018.37.2.1b**

*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*
<br/>


*where:*

>***Accession Year**** = the year in which the collection is accessioned

>***Collection Number*** = the order in which the collection was accessioned in that accession year 

>***Work Number*** = the work (or object) number in the accessioned collection. 
>>Note that works (or objects) can only share work numbers when they are within the same collection.

>***Instantiation Number*** = a number for the instantiation of a work (or object)

>***Component Element*** = starting with letter **a**, letter all films first then number all cans, reels and ephemera as components or accessories to their associated component element.

>>(For films to be projected, i.e., 35mm showprint collections, a reel number may be added to the physical film head/tail leader and can for projection booth clarity: reel number = R1 for reel 1, R2 for reel 2, R3 for reel 3, etc.)

## **Motion Picture Film**

### This section describes how motion picture films and their assocaited components and/or accessories numbered. 
#### It also desceribes how digital preservation files and derivatives are named.  

<br/>
The most general formulation for numbering films on one reel is:

>**2018.37.2.1a**  
>*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*  

<br/>  
The most general formulation for numbering films on multiple reels is:

>**2018.37.2.1a**  
>**2018.37.2.1b**  
>*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*

<br/>


*where:*


>***Accession Year*** = the year in which the collection is accessioned

>***Collection Number*** = the order in which the collection was accessioned in that accession year 

>***Work Number*** = the work (or object) number in the accessioned collection. 
>> ###### Note that works (or objects) can only share work numbers when they are within the same collection.

>***Instantiation Number*** = a number for the instantiation of a work (or object)

>***Component Element*** = starting with letter **a**, letter all films first then number all cans, reels and ephemera as components or accessories to their associated component element.

>> ###### (For films to be projected, i.e., 35mm showprint collections, a reel number may be added to the physical film head/tail leader and the film can for projection booth clarity: reel number = R1 for reel 1, R2 for reel 2, R3 for reel 3, etc.)

*Mixed archival collections containing time-based works, such as the Pearl Bowser collection, have a Series Number inserted between the Collection Number and Work Number. This number is used to indicate the type of media carrier.*

>1. motion picure film: - all gauges and bases
>2. video: tape-based video formats, both cassette and open-reel   
>3. audio: tape-based audio formats, both cassetes and open-reel
>4. optical discs: all optical disc formats - DVD, CD, Laserdisc, etc.
>5. digital carriers: all digital carriers - harddrives, thumbdrives, computer disks, etc.
>>> ###### the content of the digital carrier, e.g. digital photos, digital video, digital audio, software, word processing documents, etc., does not impact the numbering
>6. photographs: silver based, other analog processes and printed digital images
>7. paper items: all loose leaf paper items, flyers, posters, etc.
>8. bound paper items: books and magazines
>9. objects: furniture, trophies, clothing, all other objects

The character '<font size="+1">**a**</font>' `must` be used to designate the first physical carrier for the essence or signal (videotape, audiotape or film), and that the subsequent characters be used for any remaining phsyical carriers in the instantiation. Any containers, cans, cases or other ephemera related to the physical carrier will likley be accessory components in TMS.
>> ###### acessory components in TMS are differentiated from "part of an object" components.  
<br/> 

For example, where the work is a feature film in a can on one reel/core with Work Number 2018.37.2, the film itself will have the Instantiation Number '<font size="+1">**1**</font>' with Component Element '<font size="+1">**a**</font>', e.g. **2018.37.2.1a**, while the reel/core holding the film will have the Instantiation Number (with Accessory Suffix) 2099.67.3.1a_acc1 and the canister holding the reel will have the Instantiation Number (with Suffix Element ) 2099.67.3.1a_acc2 and were a lightcard or other piece of filmlab paper ephemera ro information to be contained in the canister it will have the Instantiation Number (with Suffix Element) 2099.67.3.1a_acc3 and so on..
